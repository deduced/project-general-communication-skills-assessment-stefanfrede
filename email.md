Subject: Setting up a box for a week to collect toys for small children

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing you because I would like to set-up a box either inside or outside
your café for a week to collect toys for small children.

There are still a lot of refugees arriving in Munich which most often do not own
much more than the clothes they are wearing.

A lot of these refugees have small children with them which already had to
endure way too much in their short lives than a child should endure.

To brighten up there lives a little bit and give them a break I would like to
set-up a box either inside or outside your café for a week to collect toys for
them.

I believe that this small gesture even if it seems like nothing big compared to
what most of them experienced so far will help them get their minds off all
these drudgeries at least a little bit and therefor improve their lives for this
short moment a lot.

If you are willing to do this it would be great if we could promote this event
on your website and with a sign at your front door to make as much of your
customers aware of this as possible.

After the week I would collect the box and make sure it gets to Munich's
official gathering place for refugee donations.

It would be truly great if we can do this!

Kind regards,

Stefan Frede
