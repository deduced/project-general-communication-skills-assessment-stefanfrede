#### Project Assignment 2: Assessing Your General Communication Skill

The following assignment assesses your general communication skills and
simultaneously allows you to make a positive impact on the world, even if in
a seemingly small way.6

Write one of the following professional emails and email it to the appropriate
recipient (also submit the email, written in Markdown, via Github classroom):  

1. Write to a major cafe or restaurant in your neighborhood and ask the manager
   to host a small toy giveaway for children. The manager will need to put a box
   or container just outside or inside the cafe or restaurant, and ask patrons
   to donate a toy for charity. Instruct the manager specifically about which
   local charities his store can partner with to pick up the toys and distribute
   them to the children who need them most.  

2. Write to the manager of your company or to the CEO asking him or her to
   implement an optional day of service for employees. During this day of
   service, the employees will be allowed to take at least half a day off to
   volunteer at a charity by serving at a food bank, teach programming or
   computer or mobile use to adults or children in need, or teach English as
   a foreign language at a local library, etc.  
   The program can serve as a pilot program before it is implemented
   company-wide. Discuss how the program can benefit your company and its
   employees, while serving a broader philanthropic need. Discuss any help you
   can provide in organizing such an event. This may include any current
   connections you have in your community, or connections with non-profit
   organizations that can partner with your company or organization to implement
   a pilot program.  

3. Write to a local restaurant or grocery store in your area and ask the manager
   if they donate their leftovers and unspoiled food every day. If they throw it
   away, ask them to contact their head office (if any) to inquire about
   partnering with a local charity or food bank to pick up the excess food every
   day.  

4. Write to a local university and ask the president of the university to host
   a day where anyone from anywhere—especially kids and young adults—can come
   and take a free introductory programming course and use the technologies at
   the university. The school’s professors could get involved and host free,
   mini tech lectures.
